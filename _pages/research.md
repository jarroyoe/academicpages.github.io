## Modeling of spatial dynamics of ecosystem engineers
<img style="float: left;" src="https://jarroyoe.github.io/images/Kelp_forest-blue.jpg" width="300" height="180"> I am currently interested in the development and analysis of generalized and specific models, using Reaction-Diffusion equations and Integrodifference equations to understand how ecosystem engineers such as sea urchins spread through their habitat. Based on these analytical results, I am interested in understanding how different management decisions (such as increased connectivity of a fragmented habitat or limitation of fishing of a specific population) may affect the fate of a species in an ecosystem.

## Modeling of biological control in coffee production
<img style="float: left;" src="https://jarroyoe.github.io/images/hemileia_vastatrix.jpg" width="300" height="180"> My undergraduate research project revolved about defining strategies for biological control of coffee rust using spatial dynamical systems. We modelled the coffee rust populations of each coffee tree using ordinary differential equations interacting in a discrete graph and we introducedbiological control sources to the system and analyze how these populations interact with each other.
