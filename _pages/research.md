## Analysis of restoration strategies of kelp forests in the northern coast of California
<img style="float: left;" src="https://jarroyoe.github.io/images/sea-urchins.jpg" width="300" height="180"> I am developing an Integrodifference Equation model to describe the interaction between bull kelp (<i>Nereocystis luetkeana) and its predator, the purple sea urchin (<i>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus<\i>) to analyze potential strategies to restore the kelp forest ecosystem in the northern coast of California.

## Modeling of spatial dynamics of ecosystem engineers
<img style="float: left;" src="https://jarroyoe.github.io/images/Kelp_forest-blue.jpg" width="300" height="180"> I am currently interested in the development and analysis of generalized models using Reaction-Diffusion equations to understand how ecosystem engineers such as sea urchins spread through their habitat. Based on these analytical results, I am interested in understanding how different management decisions (such as increased connectivity of a fragmented habitat or limitation of fishing of a specific population) may affect the fate of a species in an ecosystem.

## Modeling of biological control in coffee production
<img style="float: left;" src="https://jarroyoe.github.io/images/hemileia_vastatrix.jpg" width="300" height="180"> My undergraduate research project revolved about defining strategies for biological control of coffee rust (<i>Hemileia vastatrix<\i>) using spatial dynamical systems. We modelled the coffee rust populations of each coffee tree using ordinary differential equations interacting in a discrete graph and we introducedbiological control sources to the system and analyze how these populations interact with each other.
