## Modeling of biological control in coffee production
<img style="float: left;" src="https://jarroyoe.github.io/images/hemileia_vastatrix.jpg" width="300" height="180"> My undergraduate research project revolved about defining strategies for biological control of coffee rust using spatial dynamical systems. We modelled the coffee rust populations of each coffee tree using ordinary differential equations interacting in a discrete graph and we introducedbiological control sources to the system and analyze how these populations interact with each other.
